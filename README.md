# Problem Set: Structured Problem Solving

### Directions
1. Run `npm install` to load project dependencies.
2. Complete coding exercises in the `exercises.js` file. (You will find the questions in `problem-set.md` and unit tests in `exercises.test.js`)
3. Test your code often by running `npm test`.
4. Check for style by running `eslint exercises.js` in the terminal. If you do not already have eslint installed, run `npm install -g eslint`.

   **Note:** You are not done with your exercises until all tests pass and there are no eslint errors.

When you are done, push your final commits and submit through Canvas.
